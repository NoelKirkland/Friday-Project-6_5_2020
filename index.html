      <h2>Fill out the information below to help identify which coding languange is right for you!</h2>
      <p>So, you have been thinking about getting into computer programming but you are just not sure which computer programming language is right for you. Have you ever thought about if you might like a <span class="clickable" id="front-end">front-end</span> language as opposed to a <span class="clickable" id="back-end">back-end</span> language? Or what about you as a person; have you ever thought about which language might be most compatible with your personality? Have you thought about how many long hours it might take studying to become a master computer programmer? Hopefully this webpage can help you clear up some of those questions, suggest which programming language or languages would fit you best, and give you an idea of how long it might take to perfect your skills.</p>

      <div id="back-showing">
        <blockquote>
